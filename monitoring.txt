		"I’d like to see us start thinking of monitoring as a service. Can we create an alert and log message pipeline so that others in the company can subscribe to certain portions and build tools? Can we make tools that allow for monitoring and message passing to be self-service so that operations isn’t a bottleneck for setting up monitoring and logging, and some of the responsibility can be shared with the appropriate people. I imagine a system where the data flows freely and really smart people (way smarter than I) make awesome internal tools."
